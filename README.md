### Hi there ğŸ‘‹



   - ğŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @sophrosyne42
   - ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
   - ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux, open source, functional programming, and cool math stuff like linear algebra.
   - ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all sorts of stuff. I'm working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Get Programming with Haskell, 0DE3.net. I love learning about pretty much anything, and I'm a leaf on the wind when it comes to where I go next.
