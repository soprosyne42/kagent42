### Hi there 👋



   - 👋 I’m @kagent42
   - 😄 Pronouns: she/her
   - 👀 I’m interested in Linux, open source, functional programming, and cool math stuff like linear algebra.
   - 🌱 I’m currently learning all sorts of stuff. I'm working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Get Programming with Haskell, 0DE3.net. I love learning about pretty much anything, and I'm a leaf on the wind when it comes to where I go next
